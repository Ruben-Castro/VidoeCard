# VidoeCard
Completed tutorial from trailingclousure.com on how to create a video card in swift UI. Looking forward to including this in future projects 

## What I Learned 

### AVKit
 - I learned the basics of AVKit Apples high level interface for video playback
 
### UIViewRepresentables 
- I learned how to represent UIView in swift ui by implementing the UIViewRepresentables delegate on the swiftUI Struct.
This alows us to embed uikit components in swift UI. 

### Timer 
- I learned how to use the Timer function to loop restart the video player and give the apperance of a looping video preview.
