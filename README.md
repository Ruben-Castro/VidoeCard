Completed tutorial from https://trailingclosure.com/learn-how-to-create-a-video-card-using-swiftui/ on how to create a video card in swift UI. Looking forward to including this in future projects 

## What I Learned 

### AVKit
 - I learned the basics of AVKit Apple's high level interface for video playback
 
### UIViewRepresentables 
- I learned how to represent UIView components in swiftUI by implementing the UIViewRepresentables protocol on a swiftUI Struct.
This alows us to embed uikit components in swift UI. 

### Timer
